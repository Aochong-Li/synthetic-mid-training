      "Answer: Let's think step by step. Peptidoglycan is known to comprise the plasma membrane of most bacteria, rather than the exoskeleton of arthropods, which is made of chitin, which rules out (A). The answer (C) is false because arthropods are a highly successful phylum. Likewise, arthropods have paired, jointed appendages, which rules out (D). The only remaining option is (B), as arthropods have an open circulatory system with a dorsal tubular heart. The answer is (B).\n",

      "H. 50/400\n",
      "Answer: Let's think step by step. According to the Hardy Weinberg Law, $p^2 + 2 p q + q^2 = 1$, and $p + q = 1$ where $p$ is the frequency of the dominant allele, $q$ is the frequency of the recessive allele, and $p^2$, $q^2$, and $2pq$ are the frequencies of dominant homozygous, recessive homozygous, and heterozygous individuals, respectively. ​The frequency of the recessive allele (q) is $\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{400}} = 0.05$. We have $p = 1 - q = 0.95$. The frequency of heterozygous individuals is $2pq = 2 \\cdot 0.05 \\cdot 0.95 = 0.095$. The number of heterozygous individuals is equal to the frequency of heterozygous individuals times the size of the population, or $0.095 * 400 = 38$. So we end up with 38/400. The answer is (D).\n",

      "Question: A mutation in a bacterial enzyme changed a previously polar amino acid into a nonpolar amino acid. This amino acid was located at a site distant from the enzyme’s active site. How might this mutation alter the enzyme’s substrate specificity?\n",
      "Options:\n",
      "A. By changing the enzyme’s pH optimum\n",
      "B. By changing the enzyme's molecular weight\n",
      "C. An amino acid change away from the active site increases the enzyme's substrate specificity.\n",
      "D. By changing the shape of the protein\n",
      "E. By changing the enzyme's temperature optimum\n",
      "F. By altering the enzyme's ability to be denatured\n",
      "G. By changing the enzyme’s location in the cell\n",
      "H. By changing the enzyme's color\n",
      "I. An amino acid change away from the active site cannot alter the enzyme’s substrate specificity.\n",
      "J. By altering the enzyme's rate of reaction\n",
      "Answer: Let's think step by step. A change in an amino acid leads to a change in the primary structure of the protein. A change in the primary structure may lead to a change in the secondary and the tertiary structure of the protein. A change in the tertiary structure means a change in the shape of the protein, so (C) has to be correct. Since the change does not affect the active site of the enzyme, we do not expect the activity of the enzyme to be affected. The answer is (D).\n",

      "Question: Which of the following is not a way to form recombinant DNA?\n",
      "Options:\n",
      "A. Translation\n",
      "B. Conjugation\n",
      "C. Specialized transduction\n",
      "D. Transformation\n",
      "Answer: Let's think step by step. The introduction of foreign DNA or RNA into bacteria or eukaryotic cells is a common technique in molecular biology and scientific research. There are multiple ways foreign DNA can be introduced into cells including transformation, transduction, conjugation, and transfection. In contrast, (A) is not a way to form DNA: during translation the ribosomes synthesize proteins from RNA. The answer is (A).\n",

      "F. Mitochondria\n",
      "G. Protein kinases\n",
      "H. Fibroblast cells\n",
      "Answer: Let's think step by step. Normal cells move through the cell cycle in a regulated way. At the checkpoint stage, they use information about their own internal state and cues from the environment around them to decide whether to proceed with cell division. Cues like these act by changing the activity of core cell cycle regulators inside the cell. The most common regulators are cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases. Fibroblast cells do not play any role in cell division. The answer is (H).\n",
